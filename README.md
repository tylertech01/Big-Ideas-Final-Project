Abstract: 

During our process of determining which neighborhood in Pittsburgh is the best, we looked at 3 different data sets.  One relating to covid tests and deaths in each neighborhood, the number of deaths by neighborhood from 2011-2015, and the fire incidents reported in each neighborhood.  Through our data manipulation, we were looking for a neighborhood with a low rate of death, low amout of covid cases and related death, and low rate of fire incidents.  The best neighborhood is determined by the people, and whether or not they can avoid covid, death, and fire.
